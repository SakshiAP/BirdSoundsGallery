# BirdSoundsGallery

Welcome to the **BirdSoundsGallery** project! This web application displays bird images randomly on a nature-themed background. When you click on a bird image, the corresponding bird sound plays.

## Features

- **Random Bird Images:** Bird images are displayed randomly each time the page is refreshed.
- **Interactive Sounds:** Clicking on a bird image plays the respective bird sound.
- **Non-overlapping Images:** Bird images are positioned to avoid overlapping with each other.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** for the structure of the web page.
- **CSS** for styling and positioning of elements.
- **JavaScript** for interactive functionality and audio playback.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that sets up the page structure.
- **styles.css**: The CSS file that styles the page and positions the elements.
- **script.js**: The JavaScript file that handles the logic for displaying images and playing sounds.
